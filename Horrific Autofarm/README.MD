# Horrific autofarm
an autofarm for [Horrific Housing](https://www.roblox.com/games/263761432/Horrific-Housing)

what this script does:
1. Create a platform in a random position (math.random(240, 580), math.random(120, 550), math.random(240, 580) and puts it into the Workspace
2. Teleport the player to that platform
3. Teleport the player whenever they move from that platform
- avoid stuff that could kill the player
- server hop if there is no other players in the server

best in small servers
