an autofarm for [Horrific Housing](https://www.roblox.com/games/263761432/Horrific-Housing)

very simple script, all it does is:
1. Create a platform in a random position (math.random(240, 580), math.random(120, 550), math.random(240, 580) and puts it into the Workspace
2. Teleport the player to that platform
3. Teleport the player whenever they move from that platform

best in small servers
